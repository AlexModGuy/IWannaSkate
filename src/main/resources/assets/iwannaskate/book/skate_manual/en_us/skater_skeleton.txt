The Skater Skeleton is a rare skeleton that can be encountered wielding a skateboard rather than the usual bow.
These hostile monsters can only spawn on smooth, solid blocks, such as stone, which are fitting for them to skate on.
<NEWLINE>
When attacking, the Skater Skeleton will attempt to use its skateboard to chase after its target, bashing into them if possible.
It will also pick up its skateboard and use it as a melee weapon, dealing significant damage.
<NEWLINE>
If slain, the Skater Skeleton will drop bones, Skateboard Wheels, and possibly its Skateboard or helmet.
<NEWLINE>
Skater Skeletons are one of the few ways to naturally obtain Skateboard Wheels, which are a necessary component of a Skateboard.
The helmet that these skeletons wear also enables them to deal slight melee damage when colliding with other creatures when skating - an ability that anyone who wears it can also use.

Although naturally rare, Skater Skeletons can be found plaguing any manually built skate park.
