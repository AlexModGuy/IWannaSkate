Many skating tricks are purely situational, and can only be preformed under certain conditions.
For example, grinding can only be preformed if a Skateboard lands on a wall, fence, rail or iron bars.

While skating and not pedalling, you may notice the jump bar above the hotbar.
If the jump key is held down, this bar will fill up, and when released an ollie or a kickflip is preformed.
A kickflip will grant larger airtime than an ollie, but it can only be preformed if the jump bar is filled to the orange section.

If an energy drink is purchased from a Wandering Skater and drunk, one can be granted with the High Octane effect.
This effect slows down time temporarily while preforming a trick, with a slower motion effect if drank multiple times.
But if over-consumed, this item will inflict the Overcaffeniated effect, which can give jitters to the inflicted skater, along with making them take random damage.
