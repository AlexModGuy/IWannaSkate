Skateboards can be extremely customized using a variety of different items.
The wheels of a Skateboard can be dyed any of the 16 valid colors.
To swap the wheels of a Skateboard out with another pair, simply place two Skateboard Wheels in the crafting grid with the Skateboard. The previous wheels will also be returned.

The surface of a Skateboard can also be changed. By placing a Skateboard in the crafting grid with a carpet, the board can be given a grip tape of that color on top.

With all these customization options, you may want a way to display all of your unique designs.
Luckily the Skateboard Rack can be crafted and placed on a wall, which can hold two Skateboards for display purposes.
